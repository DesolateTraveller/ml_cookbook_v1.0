        This repository explains the stages of 'Feature Engineering' and 'Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)'

        Feature engineering
        
        (1) It is a very important part of dataset preparation. 
        (2) During the process, It creates a set of attributes (input features) that represent various behavior patterns towards the target features. 
        (3) In a broad sense, features are the measurable characteristics of observations that a ML model takes into account to predict outcomes.
    
        A typical "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)" consists of the following steps:
    
        1 | Feature Import:                      Import and read the collected dataset.
        2 | Feature Removal:                     Remove unwanted features.
        3 | Feature Identification:              Variable type identifications.
        4 | Feature Visualization:               Graphical representation of univariate and bi-variate analysis.
        5 | Feature Scaling:                     Rescaling the features.  
        6 | Feature Cleaning:                    Checking missing values, duplicate values and outliers and do the required treatment. 
        7 | Feature Encoding:                    Conversion of the categorical variable into continuous variable.
        8 | Feature Selection:                   Checking of multi-collinearity, p values, Recursive feature elimination (via chi-square method).
        9 | Feature Sampling:                    Redefine the datasets to increase the performance.
