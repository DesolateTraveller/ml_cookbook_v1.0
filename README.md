This repository explains the each stages of 'feature engineering' and 'exploratory data analysis (EDA)'

        Feature engineering
        It is a very important part of dataset preparation. 
        During the process, It create a set of attributes (input features) that represent various behavior patterns towards the target features. 
        In a broad sense, features are the measurable characteristics of observations that a ML model takes into account to predict outcomes.
    
        A typical **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** consists of the following steps:
    
        - 1 | **Feature Import** :               Import and read the collected dataset.
        - 2 | **Feature Removal** :              Remove unwanted features.
        - 3 | **Feature Identification** :       Variable type identifications.
        - 4 | **Feature Visualization** :        Graphical representation of univariate and bi variate analysis.
        - 5 | **Feature Scalling** :             Rescalling the features.  
        - 6 | **Feature Cleaning** :             Checking missing values, duplicate values and outlier and do the required treatment. 
        - 7 | **Feature Encoding** :             Conversion of the categorical variable into continuous variable.
        - 8 | **Feature Selection** :            Checking of multi collinearity, p values, Recursive feature elimination (via chi-square method).
        - 9 | **Feature Sampling** :             Redefine the datasets to increase the performance.
